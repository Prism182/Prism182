- Hello I'm prism!
- I'm a full time student with a passion for programming and coding, I sometimes make some random things in python, lua, java, and any other programming lang I get my hands on.
- Currently I am teaching myself java by developing a minecraft mod! This mod isnt currently available, but if you would like to play it, It will be posted here!
- I dont currently have the social battery nor the capacity to collaborate on anything as of right now, im too much of a loner to do this, lol.
- If you must contact me, you can't... sorry (not sorry), ill probably set up a gmail account for you to email, but dont expect me to check it often. (Ill post this email here sometime... im too lazy for it right now)
