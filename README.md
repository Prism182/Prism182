- 👋 Hi, I’m @Prism182.
- 👀 I’m interested in making random things in coding languages that I have either never touched before and know nothing about or know tiny snippets of code from and want to learn more about them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything as of right now, although this may change in the future
- 📫 How to reach me contact@prism182.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know it would only take 10 minuites to hack a computer through brute force means on the same network? no? well me neither until I tested it on an old computer of mine
